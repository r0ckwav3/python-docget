Bugs:
- elif
- some pages reference images that atom doesn't like (because I don't have the images locally)

Possible new features:
- search bar
- random.randint works correctly
- better search priority (eg builtins go first)
- the ability to scroll

Things to keep in mind:
- figure out what's going on with all the console errors when I close a window and maybe fix them
