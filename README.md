# python-docget

A package for [atom](atom.io) which adds a way to search python documentation in a side panel.

### How to download
You can't currently (unless you just clone the repository), but eventually I'll put this on `apm`.

### Current Features
- Use `cmd+alt+p` to search a selected phrase
- returns relevant built-in functions
- shows function defenition and documentation in-editor

### Future Features
- Better formatting
- The sidebar opens when you first try to search
- Have a search bar in the sidebar as well
